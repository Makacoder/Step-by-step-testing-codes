# Introduction

This project is a Grazaz Academy accelerator challenge 2 assigned to student Backend developer. As a junior backend developer, I am tasked with building endpoints for a train transport company app where users are able to sign up, login,make successful bookings, edit booking time, delete bookings and can see all services provided by the train transport company.

I'm also expected to create in the platform where Admin will be able to see all users, upload new reservation for users to book, and lastly know the total number of bookings done on the platform.

## Building and creating endpoints for booking app

In this pattern, we show how to create endpoints for Users and Admin, then profiling Admin rights for authentication and authorization using jason web token.
